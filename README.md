# AI Climate Adaptation Chat Application

## Overview
This project aims to build an **AI-powered chat application** designed to assist users in understanding and adapting to climate change. Whether you are looking for practical solutions for environmental sustainability, weather impact insights, or advice on local adaptations, this chat application will provide reliable and tailored responses.

## Features (In Progress)
- **AI-Assisted Conversations:** Real-time responses powered by artificial intelligence to answer questions and provide guidance on climate adaptation and sustainable practices.
- **Localized Climate Insights:** Personalized advice based on user location, with recommendations on how to mitigate and adapt to local climate conditions.
- **Educational Support:** Resourceful information to help users stay informed about climate change, green initiatives, and adaptation strategies.

## Project Status
The development of the AI Climate Adaptation Chat Application is currently in its **early stages**. The team is actively working on:
- Setting up the core AI chat functionality.
- Integrating reliable climate data sources for accurate information.
- Building an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository or download the project files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victor-jaber/bcg-challenge.git
cd bcg-challenge
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .pyenv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using the command appropriate for your operating system:

- **Linux or macOS**:
  ```bash
  source .pyenv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .pyenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
